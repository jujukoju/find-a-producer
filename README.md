## Producer Information Scraper
This project combines API-based data retrieval and web scraping to explore music metadata. The flow takes a song title and artist, searches Spotify and ensures it exists, fetches song and producer details from Genius, and then scrapes the producer’s Genius page to list other songs they’ve worked on, all neatly displayed in a Streamlit web app.
